# Realtime communication with WebRTC

This code has the resources you need for the codelab [Realtime communication with WebRTC](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/#0).

This is a work in progress. If you find a mistake or have a suggestion, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/webrtc-web/issues). Thanks!

## What you'll learn
* Get video from your webcam
* Stream video with RTCPeerConnection
* Stream data with RTCDataChannel
* Set up a signaling service to exchange messages
* Combine peer connection and signaling
* Take a photo and share it via a data channel


## What you'll need
* Chrome 47 or above.
* Web Server for Chrome, or use your own web server of choice.
* The sample code.
* A text editor.

# What I have learned yet
* Get a mediastream(video,audio) from your webcam.
* Manipulate stream playback.
* Use the RTCPeerConnection API to stream video.
* How to exchange data between WebRTC endpoints (peers).
* STUN, TURN servers: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/
