# Live-multi-lingual-communication
Build a WEBRTC peer to peer application (video and audio).
First user story:  I can read the text of what the other person is speaking.  If I mute my audio, I can read what they are talking about.
Second user story:  I can read the text in other languages.
Stretch goal:  I can hear the audio i other langauges.
Fourth goal: store the text of speech into a document.
Hint:  it doe snto have to be real time.  Almost realtime is ok.

### User Story
* I, a worker who wfh, have to mute the audio but know the content of speech in an interrupted situation like receiving a phone call.
* I, an owner of a foreign commerce startup company, would like to use this app to do foreign trades and save costs.
* I, having reading disability, would like to hear the translation rather than reading it.
* I, a secretary, would like to record the text of a meeting automatically.
